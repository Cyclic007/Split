## 10/4/2025 - setup the scematic  

I made the scematic and I am planning on using MX switches and the rp2040 zero for my micro controller on each side. This will probobly be a wired keyboard. I will be doing layouts with QMK and haveing the keeb use layers. There are going to be 24 keys on each side with 6 cols and 4 rows.

## 10/7/2025 - changeing the micro controller and finishing the main keeb  

I have made the dicision to change to useing Adafruit KB2040 - RP2040 to make the keeb wireless. I also fixed the labels being wrong. I also made my scematic better and removed the 6th col because I only have 5 fingers and I also removed one button from the thumb row. I also finished roughting the keeb part of the PCB.
